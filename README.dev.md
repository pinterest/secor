## Dependencies

### Bumping to new default kafka version 

* Make new profile if it doesn't exist, matching kafka version as id tag.
* Ensure the new profile is the only one active pr default with `activation->activeByDefault`
* Change release profile to have the same stuff in it's profile. (used for
  buildservers who signs artifacts with GPG and attach javadocs and pushes to
public M2 repository..)
* Update MVN_PROFILE in `Makefile`
* Update .travis and add it into the matrix, so CI runs tests for your kafka
  version profile.

Profit.

### scala versions

Ensure you check `mvn dependency:tree` and ensure you don't pull in libraries
compiled with different scala versions. This is bad.
