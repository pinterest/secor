# Properties for using Kafka before 2.0.0
#

# Parameter which tells whether to extract Kafka message timestamp. This value is to be chose in case of 0.10.x kafka brokers.
# Default value is false. Also specify `kafka.message.timestamp.className` as `com.pinterest.secor.timestamp.Kafka10MessageTimestamp`,
# in case you are enabling this parameter as `true`.
kafka.useTimestamp=false

# Classname for the timestamp field you want to use. Default is `com.pinterest.secor.timestamp.Kafka10MessageTimestamp`
# for 0.10 build profile. Basically, it will be `Kafka8MessageTimestamp` for 0.8 kafka and `Kafka10MessageTimestamp`
# for 0.10 kafka. Fully classified names are `com.pinterest.secor.timestamp.Kafka8MessageTimestamp` and
# `com.pinterest.secor.timestamp.Kafka10MessageTimestamp`.
kafka.message.timestamp.className=com.pinterest.secor.timestamp.Kafka10MessageTimestamp

# Classname for the message iterator you want to use. The message iterator determines what kind of consumer
# secor will use to communicate with kafka. com.pinterest.secor.reader.LegacyKafkaMessageIterator uses
# the old kafka consumer written scala. Its not recommended to use the legacy iterator with kafka version >= 1.0 since it
# does not support the new broker protocols. You may face significant performance degradation on your brokers if you use it
kafka.message.iterator.className=com.pinterest.secor.reader.LegacyKafkaMessageIterator

# Classname for the kafka client used by utility classes like PartitionFinalizer and Progress monitor.
# Legacy client is kept for compatibility purposes and is deprecated
kafka.client.className=com.pinterest.secor.common.LegacyKafkaClient
